It results in more beautiful and stunning looking environments, textures, and materials in the game.But better looks does not guarantee better frame rates. And also there are not many games in the market that support ray tracing.</p></div></div><div component-name="studio-grid-row" class="row" style="width:100%;"><div component-name="studio-grid-col" class="center-xs col-xs-offset-0 col-xs-12" component-height="2" component-ystart="10"><p studio-id="difference_Label_1955" component-name="studio-label">These are some basic differences between the two cards. The RTX 2080 is capable of beating the GTX 1080Ti in 4K gaming. 2080 uses a faster GDDR6 memory which results in better resolutions.</p></div></div><div component-name="studio-grid-row" class="row" style="width:100%;"><div component-name="studio-grid-col" class="center-xs col-xs-offset-0 col-xs-12" component-height="2" component-ystart="12"><p studio-id="difference_Label_1953" component-name="studio-label">It also offers additional rendering improvements being a Turing architecture card and also supports Real-Time Ray Tracing and DLSS, plus its price is less when compared to its counterpart.</p></div></div><div component-name="studio-grid-row" class="row" style="width:100%;"><div component-name="studio-grid-col" class="center-xs col-xs-offset-0 col-xs-12" component-height="2" component-ystart="14"><p studio-id="difference_Label_6601" component-name="studio-label">While these things may sound impressive, there is no real reason to use the RTX card if you don&#x2019;t care much about the visuals. Since 4K monitors are very expensive and enabling ray tracing may reduce your frame rates, the GTX 1080Ti gives better performance in some games when compared to the RTX 2080.</p></div></div><div component-name="studio-grid-row" class="row" style="width:100%;"><div component-name="studio-grid-col" class="center-xs col-xs-offset-0 col-xs-12" component-height="2" component-ystart="16"><p studio-id="difference_Label_6825" component-name="studio-label">Verdict: Nvidia&#x2019;s GTX 1080Ti will give better performance in some games but it is not worth the extra amount it costs and since the RTX cards come with additional features of Ray tracing and DLSS it is a good choice for mid to high-end PCs and since more and more games are supporting ray tracing it is a good choice for the present as well as the future.</p></div></div><div component-name="studio-grid-row" class="row" style="width:100%;"><div component-name="studio-grid-col" class="center-xs col-xs-offset-0 col-xs-12" component-height="2" component-ystart="18"><p studio-id="difference_Label_1579" component-name="studio-label">References :</p></div></div><div component-name="studio-grid-row" class="row" style="width:100%;"><div component-name="studio-grid-col" class="center-xs col-xs-offset-0 col-xs-12" component-height="2" component-ystart="20"><p studio-id="difference_Label_2037" component-name="studio-label">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeForce_20_series</p></div></div><div component-name="studio-grid-row" class="row" style="width:100%;"><div component-name="studio-grid-col" class="center-xs col-xs-offset-0 col-xs-12" component-height="2" component-ystart="22"><p studio-id="difference_Label_3594" component-name="studio-label">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia_RTX</p></div></div><div component-name="studio-grid-row" class="row" style="width:100%;"><div component-name="studio-grid-col" class="center-xs col-xs-offset-0 col-xs-12" component-height="2" component-ystart="24"><ion-img studio-id="difference_Image_6362" component-name="studio-image" style="width: 240px; height: 240px; background: transparent !important;" src="build/assets/imgs/NVIDIA-RTX-vs-GTX.jpg"></ion-img></div></div><div component-name="studio-grid-row" class="row" style="width:100%;"><div component-name="studio-grid-col" class="center-xs col-xs-offset-0 col-xs-12" component-height="2" component-ystart="30.857142857142858"><button studio-id="difference_Button_5824" component-name="studio-button" ion-button="" (click)="difference_Button_5824_clickHandler()">AMD VS NVIDIA</button></div></div></ion-content>
